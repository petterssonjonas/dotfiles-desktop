Some of my personal dotfiles.

nvim requires vim-plug. Install it and :PlugInstall

Awesome: a lot of themes and libraries are unused. Some stuff in rc.lua like autostart is disabled, got some errors i havent gotten around to fixing.
Spotify widget requires streeturtles for of sp.
´´git clone https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547.git
        cd ./6800547
        chmod +x sp
        sudo cp ./sp /usr/local/bin/ 
´´

Use at your own risk.
